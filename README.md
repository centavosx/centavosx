## Hi, welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹

Here youâ€™ll find the codebase for all my personal projects. I havenâ€™t contributed much on GitHub since last year because Iâ€™ve been busy with my current role as a Full-stack Software Developer. But Iâ€™m planning to work on more personal projects this year since Iâ€™ve got tons of ideas in mind!


# About me
Iâ€™m a software developer from the Philippines specializing in web, mobile, and backend development. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on Web3 and AI because I believe these are the future of technology. To that end, Iâ€™m learning about various blockchain networks, such as BTC, ETH, and COSMOS, as they share common concepts but have different implementations. For now, my main focus is by developing Ethereum smart contracts using the Solidity programming language and deploying them in various Ethereum environments.

I enjoy working on a wide range of projects, regardless of its purpose. If you have a project in mind, I'd love to collaborate and help bring it to life! One of my goals is to work with professionals to expand my knowledge and combine our expertise to create innovative solutions.

# What I do?

- First of all, I do software development.
- I also design and manage database structures.
- I create pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployments.
- I don't just write code, but I create effective programming solutions.
- I also take on programming challenges, as I believe they help improve my problem-solving skills as a software developer.
